# Komoot2Connect

A script to copy completed tours from my Komoot account to my Garmin Connect account.

Instructions:

1) Create a <code>~/.config/k2c.cfg</code> file containing the login credentials for each site.  See the sample file in this repository for the format.
2) Run the <code>k2c</code> script

WARNING: Be sure that Garmin->Komoot sync is turned off, otherwise you'll end up with duplicate activities in Komoot.  It is ok to leave syncing of planned routes turned on however.
